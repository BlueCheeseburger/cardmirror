/**
 * Container-safe undo/redo for co-editing sessions.
 *
 * A CRDT undo of a container-CREATING op (Enter in the middle of a tag,
 * inserting or pasting a card, or the redo of a card deletion) deletes
 * that container — and a container delete takes every concurrent edit
 * inside it. Partner B starts typing in the half A just split off, A
 * reflexively presses Ctrl+Z, and B's typing is gone with no error:
 * the doc converges cleanly on its absence (chaos rig, 2026-09-04:
 * undo/redo at 10% of ops quadrupled lost content — 18 lost tokens + 5
 * lost heads in 20 seeds; deterministic table in the rig's notes).
 *
 * Loro's UndoManager cannot preview a step, but it can reverse one, so
 * the guard works after the fact, on a rule that needs no knowledge of
 * step boundaries (the manager MERGES nearby local changes into one
 * step, silently):
 *
 *   - A bookkeeping plugin marks a container (by its heading id) as
 *     PARTNER-TOUCHED when a remote transaction creates or changes it,
 *     and clears the mark when a local, non-undo transaction creates
 *     it or deliberately deletes it (the user's intent covers whatever
 *     the partner had done by then).
 *   - After an undo/redo lands, any heading id that vanished names a
 *     removed container. If none of them was partner-touched, the step
 *     stands.
 *   - A blocked UNDO is SKIPPED, not walled: the document is put back
 *     exactly as it was with a write the manager does not record (commit
 *     origin `UNDO_SKIP_ORIGIN`, excluded — Loro still rebases the rest of
 *     the stack over it), the step is dropped, and the undo carries on to
 *     the step before it. Reversing with `redo()` instead (the first
 *     version of this guard) left the blocked step on top of the stack
 *     for ever: every later Ctrl+Z retried it, was reversed again, and
 *     everything the user had done before it became unreachable.
 *   - COLLATERAL removals are RESCUED, and the undo stands. Loro's undo of
 *     a list move can delete a card a partner inserted beside the moved
 *     run (found 2026-10-03: drag a section, partner adds a card at its
 *     end, undo — the partner's card is gone on every peer). A container
 *     that first appeared in a REMOTE transaction was never created by
 *     any step of mine, so no undo of mine is entitled to remove it: when
 *     every partner-touched container an undo removed is of that kind,
 *     they are written back where they stood (after their nearest
 *     surviving sibling) with the same excluded commit, the rest of the
 *     undo is kept. The redo of that undo is dropped (it would re-create
 *     what the undo deleted, a second copy). Nothing is announced; nothing
 *     was lost.
 *   - A blocked REDO is still reversed (undo of the redo) and explained;
 *     it stays on the redo stack.
 *   - Container-creating and container-deleting edits are ISOLATED into
 *     undo steps of their own. The manager merges edits that land within
 *     its merge interval, so without this a skipped step would drag along
 *     the unrelated typing that happened to share its second.
 *
 * Text-only undo/redo never removes a container and is never touched;
 * the user's OWN edits inside a container never block. Session-only —
 * single-doc editing keeps ProseMirror history.
